Class Game:
- A Game is an application listener that delegates to a screen.
- It allows an application to have multiple screens.
- It executes the render() loop over and over.
- It makes the Screen handle what happens in that render loop.

Interface Screen:
- The Screen executes logic and draws things to the screen.
- There can be many screens.

Class SpriteBatch:
- A container that holds all images and textures.
- When it comes time to render, it spills them out.
- It is memory intensive, so only one should be created.

ViewPorts:
- A viewport is a window into the game world.
- Depending on the viewport used, the game will look different on each device.
- StretchViewport - Does not keep aspect ratio. Stretch to fit the screen.
- ScreenViewport - World fits screen and cuts off the access. Ie large screens see more.
- FitViewport - Scales the world to fit the screen, adding black bars where needed.

Orthographic Camera:
- Follows us around the game world and determines what the viewport displays.

Scene2d.ui:
- A layout manager for widgets that we can put on the screen.
- For example, labels.
- These widgets are placed on a stage and can be updated when things change.

Stage:
- A Stage is basically an empty box that can hold a table where widgets can be placed.
